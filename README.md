Coded the printf function in C

---

### :pencil: Description :
    • Recode of the printf function from the C library according to the C99 standard.
    • The C library printf buffer handling is not implemented.
    • Process all printf formating flags except the following :
        • Float or double types management.
        • %n flag management.
        • " * " , " ’ " and " I " (capital i) flags management.
    • Added new flags :
        • %b which prints unsigned numbers in a binary base.
        • %S formating flag, which prints a string. However, non-printable characters (ASCII value strictly smaller than 32 or greater or equal than 127) must be represented by a backslash to be followed by the character’s value in octal base.

### :exclamation: Rules :
> The whole libC is forbidden, except malloc, free and write.
